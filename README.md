## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm **Brill**, a data scientist and data analyst with a strong interest in:

- 🔄 Data Engineering (ETL & Pipelines)  
- 📈 Predictive Modeling & Machine Learning  
- 🧠 Data Mining & Classification  
- 📊 Data storytelling and visualization  

My goal is to transform raw data into **actionable insights** and **intuitive interfaces**.
